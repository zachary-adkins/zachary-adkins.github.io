Hello, my name is Zachary Adkins!

I will be graduating with a B.S. in Computer Science from Oregon State University in Spring of 2026!

As a senior, I have been working with a group of four other students to develop a NES emulator capable of running NES ROMs.

We have been developing toward emulation of all hardware components of the NES.
This includes:
  Central Processing Unit (CPU)
  Picture Processing Unit (PPU)
  Audio Processing Unit (APU)
  Mappers
  Input Handlers

Our first target was the Donkey Kong ROM. This ROM consists of a static screen (no scrolling) and tested our CPU implementation along with the fundamentals of our PPU implementation.

We ended up being able to generate a screen just like this with basic input handling after two sprints.

Our next target was the Super Mario ROM. This ROM has much more complex rendering and fully tested the capabilities of our PPU.

Development of the emulator is wrapping up and should be completed very soon!
