# Hobbies  
*Video Games*  
I've played video games for as long as I can remember. They've been an exceptional form of entertainment, and ultimately, were the inspiration for my field of study.  
*Music*  
I listen to music from a wide range of genres. I take pride in my eclectic playlist that I've created on Spotify! I enjoy working on projects that involve some sort of integration with music.  
*Spicy Food*  
I enjoy food that hurts! I've had Pepper X hot sauces, Carolina Reapers in just about every form, and I used to eat Ghost Peppers every morning with breakfast. Good luck finding something spicy that I won't try!
