Throughout my education at Oregon State University, I have worked on many projects that cover a substantial variety of CS topics!  

I started with basic Intro to Computer Science projects that taught Python and some fundamentals of programming. Then there were projects to better understand Data Structures and Algorithms. My Web Development class focused on the basics of JavaScript and then my Intro to Databases class expanded on this, where I worked with a partner to develop the front-end and back-end for a CRUD app while maintaining the standards for database design. I've delved into various paradigms of programming through multiple projects, utilizing languages such as Raku, Ruby, Racket, and Prolog.  

Most recently, I've worked on projects involving Network Security and Operating Systems. For my first OS class, I was tasked with developing a shell that followed POSIX standards. For my second OS class, I worked with MIT's JOS64, and implemented core functions to better understand how operating systems work under the hood, how memory is managed, and how the kernel interacts with the OS and a machine's hardware. For my Network Security class, I learned about network vulnerabilities and ethical hacking. I was tasked with projects that helped to develop a better understanding of how information is routed through networks, and ultimately, how the internet works. I analyzed my own private network, researching devices/hosts connected to my router and discovering open ports and vulnerable protocols, and learned various methods for handling security flaws within public and private networks.  

As a Senior, I began working on a Capstone Project with four other students. My team was responsible for developing a NES emulator capable of running NES ROMs. Our goal was to get a functional emulator up and running within three academic terms that could run a selection of NES ROMs. This has been the largest project that I have worked on in terms of scope, time commitment, and involvement with a team.  

I have plans to take a class in my last academic term that involves contributions to an open-source project of my choice. I look forward to learning about the joys of open-source software. A placeholder listing can be found below. This page will be updated when a project is selected and updated again when my contributions to that project are finalized.  

The links in the list below will take you to the page for the designated project. That page will go into much more detail regarding each project!
